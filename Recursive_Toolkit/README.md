# 🌀 Recursive Toolkit

A collection of Python functions that demonstrate the power of **recursion** for solving algorithmic problems.
This toolkit includes examples that visualize recursion through countdowns, shape printing, progress indicators, and file system traversal.


## 🚀 Features

* Recursive countdown that prints from a starting number to zero
* Hourglass pattern generator using asterisks (`*`)
* Recursive progress bar builder
* Recursive file search counting file occurrences in directories
* Uses helper functions and base/recursive cases
* Clean, modular code with detailed docstrings



## 🧩 Problems Overview

### 1. Countdown (`create_countdown`)

Prints a countdown from a given number to zero recursively.

### 2. Hourglass (`hourglass`)

Prints a symmetrical hourglass shape using recursion and string centering.

### 3. Progress Bar (`progress_bar`)

Recursively builds a visual progress bar based on completion percentage.

### 4. File Occurrence Counter (`num_occurrences`)

Recursively searches directories and subdirectories for files matching a given filename.

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

* Recursion and base/recursive case design
* Helper functions for structured recursion
* File system navigation with the `os` module
* String formatting and alignment
* Algorithmic thinking and clean modular code
* Docstring usage for documentation


## ▶️ How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed on your computer.
2. Open the file **`Recursive_Toolkit.py`** in IDLE or your terminal.
3. Test individual functions by calling them interactively or within your own scripts.
