### Ultimate Disneyland App (Educational Project)
A Python-based project created for a programming class, inspired by the theme park experience. This is an unofficial and educational simulation of ticketing and ride-tracking features.
Combines ticketing and ride tracking in one Python program. Calculates ticket costs and tracks ride wait times.
