# My Coding Portfolio

Welcome! This portfolio showcases Python projects I’ve built, demonstrating problem-solving, data handling, and object-oriented programming skills. Each project includes code samples, screenshots, and usage instructions.

##  Projects

## RPG Character Simulator
A Python program that simulates characters, players, and enemies with combat mechanics, inheritance, and operator overloading. Includes refactoring of previous code for better modularity and readability.

### Ultimate Disneyland App (Educational Project)
A Python-based project created for a programming class, inspired by the theme park experience. This is an unofficial and educational simulation of ticketing and ride-tracking features.
Combines ticketing and ride tracking in one Python program. Calculates ticket costs and tracks ride wait times.
